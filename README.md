This will install the following packages:

    express: The Express.js web framework.
    pug: The Pug template engine.

This will start the server on http://localhost:3000/.

You can access the following routes:

The pages are generated using the Pug template engine. You can find the Pug templates in the views/ directory. The public/ directory contains the static files (CSS, images, and JavaScript).
